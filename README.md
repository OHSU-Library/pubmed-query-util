# PubMed Query Util

## Installation

Requirements:
- Composer
- Guzzle v6.1+
- PHP/Apache

## Usage

Place in PHP executable directory; form is self POSTING so no other setup should be required.

PLEASE NOTE!
This script is very much a work in progress still with a lot of work left to be done in terms of error catching and user input sanitation. It is meant to be a proof of concept for future Library projects that will rely on getting useful results from the PubMed APIs.

## History

Last Update
2017.02.07
- Modified API usage to use WebEnv and history instead of UID list which should allow for larger query requests.

2017.02.06
- Initial version: still in testing.
